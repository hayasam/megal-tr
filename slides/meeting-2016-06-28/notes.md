# Notes from Meeting 2016-06-28 

- The '#' in qualified fragment names may be misleading
- No DTD support for XML plugins!
- No further/automated fragment type specializations for XML
- XML ```realizationOf``` is actually ```conformsTo```!
- merge ```org.softlang.megal.mi2.Artifact``` and Fragment class, maybe: FragmentArtifact extends Artifact ???
