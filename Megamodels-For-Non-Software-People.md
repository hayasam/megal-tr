# Houses

Modern houses are fairly complex works of engineering.
Their not just four walls and roof.
Todays houses also involve a multitude of different engineering, architectural and construction diciplinces.
There is masonry and timber, but also pluming, electricity and air conditioning. 
We could even further and split those diciplines into more specialized areas like roof or basement construction, waste disposal, lighting, etc.
Here is a simple tree reperesenting all those diciplince:
```
- masonry & timber
  - roof construction
  - basement constructoin
  - ...
- pluming
  - ...
- electicity
  - lighting
  - communication
    - entertainment
    - ...
  - ...
- air conditioning
  - heating
  - cooling
  - ...
```
This is actually a very primitive megamodel denoting only specialization relationships among the different engineering diciplince.
