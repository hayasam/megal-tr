# Megamodels For Non-Software People

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION!**

This document tries to illustrate our (usually CS/Software based) understanding of megamodels with a real world example most people should be familliar with.

## Megamodeling in 1 Sentence

*Megamodels try to broaden the understanding and insight of the internal workings of a domain; usually one that involves some kind of engineering.*

## Houses

Modern houses are fairly complex works of engineering.
Their not just four walls and roof.
Todays houses also involve a multitude of different engineering, architectural and construction diciplinces.
There is masonry and timber, but also pluming, electricity and air conditioning. 
We could even further and split those diciplines into more specialized areas like roof or basement construction, waste disposal, lighting, etc.
Here is a simple tree reperesenting all those diciplince:
```
- house construction
  - masonry 
    - basement constructoin
  - timber
    - roof construction
  - steelworks
  - interior
    - pluming
      - ...
    - electicity
      - lighting
      - communication
        - entertainment
        - ...
      - ...
    - air conditioning
      - heating
      - cooling
    - ...
```
This is actually a very primitive megamodel denoting only specialization relationships among the different engineering diciplince.
Keep in mind we're still talking about common houses in suburbs, not high-tech facilities like concert halls, airports, industry buildings or hotels, which involve even more engineering aspects, e.g. acustics, logistics, etc.
